# Portfolio V2 (Scratch Build)

This is an independent V2 website codebase built from scratch.

## Run locally

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

Then open:
- Legacy site: `http://localhost:9000/index.html`
- V2 site: `http://localhost:9000/portfolio-v2/index.html`

## Deployment options

1. Deploy legacy by publishing repo root.
2. Deploy V2 by publishing `portfolio-v2/` as the site root.
3. Keep both live using separate deploy targets/domains.
